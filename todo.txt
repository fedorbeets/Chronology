Features to be added:
We have some really long ass events that just roll through centuries, such as dynasties. Need a better way to display that these are still active, but not take up so much space.

the javascript array of events that gets processed simulates/emulates a database.
Really, all the data about events should be in a database, and one that is persistent.

Might want to allow background images for the articles.

BUG: Months are somehow not supported in the conversion script.
